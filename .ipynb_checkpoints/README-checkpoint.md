# Algorithms using numpy only

I am going to code the most common machine learning algorithms using only numpy. And then I will compare the results with scikit-learn built-in algorithms to evaluate the performance

**Why?** Well, first for fun. And besides I think by doing this I can get a practical understaing of basic machine learning concepts that could be useful in more complex problems  

## What algorithms:
1. Linear regression
2. Logistic regression
3. Artificial Neural Network
